# Professional Experience

## Gatesnap Labs

**In 2022**, I decided to hire some of my friends to help me _create my own software product company_. As a hobby, I race bicycle motocross professionally; I have a thorough and systemic knowledge of every aspect of the sport, and I've decided to use that experience to _launch products in an underserved niche_. We have just launched our first product - Gearbag, a truly unique cross-platform mobile application that makes it easier to calculate, compare, and adjust bicycle gearing. I've built the application with _Elm and Ionic Capacitor_.

I've not only had an opportunity to tackle greenfield engineering work in an unfamiliar domain - this is my first mobile app - but I've also been able to develop my leadership skills to a greater extent, as well as _oversee the development of a product end-to-end_. We're in our launch and marketing cycle for Gearbag right now, with a few other products in the pipeline.

Ultimately, while I believe that profitability is possible, none of these ideas are million-dollar ideas; the true value for this effort - and why it's the first piece of experience listed on my resume - is that _I can't think of a better way to develop my leadership and product engineering skills_, than to build something myself, with some of the smartest people that I know.

## Caribou Financial - Washington, DC (Remote)

**From 2022 - 2023,** I worked as a _Sr. Elm / Haskell Engineer and Tech Lead_ at Caribou Financial. I started on the product team for their insurance rate-shopping platform, and performed some major code-quality refactoring operations on our frontend - including _implementing the Builder-pattern_ for some of our input widgets, and _setting up elm-review for the codebase_. However, the insurance rate-shopping platform was de-prioritized due to lack of available marketing resources, and my team was shifted to higher-priority work within the organization.

After a brief stint working on an _event-driven Kafka data mesh in Haskell_, my team and I were assigned to own the domain of "post-fund" - i.e., activities and processes for automotive refinance loans that had been funded by new lenders. I moved to act as _Tech Lead_ and led an initiative that was projected to _increase our revenue by $250,000/mo_; unfortunately, our organization succumbed to the pressures of the economic climate, and my team was laid off along with a large portion of our engineering and product organization.

As Tech Lead, I shifted my focus away from hands-on engineering work and spent most of my time working with my Product Manager and Engineering Manager to scope, plan, scale, and schedule work. Ultimately, I'd prefer a role that has a healthier balance of engineering and leadership; but as I spend quite a bit of my time outside of my working hours writing code and building products, I am content to work in a way that gives me an opportunity to develop my people-leadership skills more directly.

## Ideal Machinery - Holly, MI

**From 2009 - 2010**, I took on the full responsibility of Ideal Machinery's IT infrastructure as their first full-time tech hire. I upgraded all workstations from Windows XP to Windows 7; removed the consumergrade networking hardware; _normalized data structures_ in their FileMaker solution; _implemented business-process and quality improvements_; and worked with a contractor to develop a basic ecommerce website in _ASP.NET MVC_.

**In 2018, and continuing until the present**, I returned as a consultant to _re-develop their e-commerce platform in Elm_. The solution I've built is a full-stack product that transforms and cleanses data from their source systems; synchronizes inventory and transaction data between their eBay store, website, and source system; and provides user-facing system-management features.

The application is currently hosted on AWS EC2 with _NGINX_; the backend is built on _F# and C# services and web APIs_ and _PostgreSQL_, with _bash scripts_ and _cron jobs_ to tie everything together. The backend is integrated with _Paccurate_ and _Shippo_, to cartonize and rate shipments; and _multiple eBay API platforms_, to manage the company's eBay store. 

The frontend is an _Elm_ application that integrates with _Stripe_ for payment processing. It exposes an admin panel that provides workflows for processing orders, manually managing listings on both the website and eBay, and displays row-level ingest errors.

During the course of this project, I have been the only developer and have written every single line of non-library code, and I have _written and maintained documentation_ so that their business doesn't close if I get hit by a _bus_. From a product perspective, I have _conceptualized, designed, and implemented all of the systems and functional areas_ with only the _vaugest occasional suggestions_ from the stakeholders within the organization.

Our current adventure is a project to _rework our physical inventory intake pipeline_ by adapting it to a paperless process.

## Bright Health Group - Austin, TX (Remote)

**From 2020 - 2022**, I worked at Bright Health Group, a health insurance startup, as a _Sr. Data Engineer_. Early on, I was involved with the design and development of a _SQL Server and SSIS_ data warehouse for healthcare provider data, and acted as the _T-SQL and C# SME_ for my team. I single-handedly designed, developed, and delivered a large ETL integration with one of our trading partners in SQL Server and SSIS, then immediately rebuilt it in _Spark / Scala / Databricks_ when our organization pivoted from Azure SQL to Databricks.

I've identified opportunities for workflow improvement, and took the initiative to build and release multiple internal frontend tools with _Elm_; my final project was a product to improve the workflow around data acquisition with _Elm and Azure Functions_. 

## WellSky - Austin, TX (Remote)

**From 2018 - 2020**, I worked as a _Data Engineer_ at WellSky, a medical-industry software company. I developed _T-SQL and SSIS integrations_ to populate a data warehouse that fed a Tableau product. I identified an opportunity to improve some of our release engineering around our Tableau product, and used _Elm and dotnet core_ to develop a web-based deployment and management tool that integrated with several internal datasources, and _Tableau Server's REST API_.

## Evans Distribution - Melvindale, MI

**From 2017 - 2018**, I worked at Evans Distribution, a family-owned transportation and logistics company. My role was _"Applications Architect"_, but I was responsible for everything from reverse-engineering decades-old Dell Boomi EDI integrations to fixing printers to building an arcade game for a trade show.

I _implemented the full suite of Atlassian products_ so that we could centralize our project planning, documentation, and helpdesk work; and _led the team on software-development best-practices_. At the owner's request, I designed, developed, and implemented a custom goal-tracking and progress management tool in _ASP.NET MVC_. I took on _project management_ responsibilities, and acted as the _interim Director of Information Technology_ for several months while the role was vacant.

## Spud Software & Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy - Flint, MI

**From 2013 - 2017**, I _wore many hats_ at Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy. For the first two years, I worked directly for Spud Software, as a full-time resource on the Diplomat account; in 2015, I was hired direct by Diplomat. I was responsible for developing _T-SQL, SSIS, and Talend_ integrations to generate and deliver hundreds of daily, weekly, and quarterly reports to pharmaceutical companies.

While at Spud, I took the lead on work for the Diplomat account and was used by Diplomat as a _lead developer and ETL architect_. I implemented processes and designed tools that allowed us to _shorten development and release cycles_. As an outcome of my work, Diplomat requested additional resources from Spud Software, and I was given the responsibility of managing Spud's presence on-site at Diplomat; at one point, I had _25 direct reports_ spread across 3 departments within the Corporate Services division. I participated in hiring and firing decisions, and was responsible for conducting annual performance reviews.

I designed a new ETL architecture and report development workflow in _Talend_, and led the initiative to migrate all of our existing reports to the new toolchain and environment. The new architecture and environment allowed us to centralize our reporting delivery configuration parameters, capture logs on all executions, inspect row-and-column-level transformations on each report, re-run reports based on the state of the data at an arbitrary point-in-time, and shorten our development and release cycles even further. In addition, I acted as our team's _Git SME_ and introduced SDLC best-practices.

After I was hired direct by Diplomat, I continued in my role as an _ETL architect_. I developed additional web-based tools in _ASP.NET MVC_ and _WPF_ to improve quality within the development / QA / release lifecycle, and developed a data warehousing and reporting environment paired to another ASP.NET MVC web application that allowed our analytics team to _query the source-to-target transformations on every row of every column of every report that we had ever generated_, and to design Tableau dashboards that _tracked how often we were sending empty or malformed data in contractually-required fields_, as part of an initiative to improve our organization's data quality.

## John Deere Landscapes - Troy, MI

**From 2010 - 2012**, I worked as an _Associate IT Analyst_ for John Deere Landscapes. I was part of a team responsible for the development and maintenance of an in-house _Windows Forms and SQL Server_ monolith that handled essential business functions, including but not limited to: sales, purchasing, instore point-of-sale, and reporting. I worked extensively on a hybrid T-SQL reporting engine.
