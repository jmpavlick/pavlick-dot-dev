# Professional Experience

## Gatesnap Labs

**In 2022**, I decided to hire some of my friends to help me **create my own software product company**. As a hobby, I race bicycle motocross professionally; I have a thorough and systemic knowledge of every aspect of the sport, and I've decided to use that experience to **launch products in an underserved niche**. We have just launched our first product - Gearbag, a truly unique cross-platform mobile application that makes it easier to calculate, compare, and adjust bicycle gearing. I've built the application with **Elm and Ionic Capacitor**. (More information is available at https://gatesnaplabs.com/)

I've not only had an opportunity to tackle greenfield engineering work in an unfamiliar domain - this is my first mobile app - but I've also been able to develop my leadership skills to a greater extent, as well as **oversee the development of a product end-to-end**. We're in our launch and marketing cycle for Gearbag right now, with a few other products in the pipeline.

Ultimately, while I believe that profitability is possible, none of these ideas are million-dollar ideas; the true value for this effort - and why it's the first piece of experience listed on my resume - is that **I can't think of a better way to develop my leadership and product engineering skills**, than to build something myself, with some of the smartest people that I know.

## Caribou Financial - Washington, DC (Remote)

**From 2022 - 2023,** I worked as a **Sr. Elm / Haskell Engineer and Tech Lead** at Caribou Financial. I started on the product team for their insurance rate-shopping platform, and performed some major code-quality refactoring operations on our frontend - including **implementing Builder-pattern** for some of our input widgets, and **setting up elm-review for the codebase**. However, the insurance rate-shopping platform has been de-prioritized in the wake of the recent economic climate, and my team has been shifted to higher-priority work within the organization.

After a brief stint working on an **event-driven Kafka data mesh in Haskell**, my team and I have landed on a project to fundamentally change the organization's relationship with its general ledger. I am currently the **Tech Lead** on an initiative that is projected to **increase our revenue by $250,000/mo starting in early 2023**; and these days I spend most of my time wading through unfamiliar codebases, documenting them, and writing well-groomed Jira stories to enable my developers to spend their time doing deep work.

## Ideal Machinery - Holly, MI

**From 2009 - 2010**, I took on the full responsibility of Ideal Machinery's IT infrastructure as their first full-time tech hire. I upgraded all workstations from Windows XP to Windows 7; removed the consumergrade networking hardware; **normalized data structures** in their FileMaker solution; **implemented business-process and quality improvements**; and worked with a contractor to develop a basic ecommerce website in **ASP.NET MVC**.

**In 2018, and continuing until the present**, I returned as a consultant to **re-develop their e-commerce platform in Elm**. The solution I've built is a full-stack product that transforms and cleanses data from their source systems; synchronizes inventory and transaction data between their eBay store, website, and source system; and provides user-facing system-management features.

The application is currently hosted on AWS EC2 with **NGINX**; the backend is built on **F# and C# services and web APIs** and **PostgreSQL**, with **bash scripts** and **cron jobs** to tie everything together. The backend is integrated with **Paccurate** and **Shippo**, to cartonize and rate shipments; and **multiple eBay API platforms**, to manage the company's eBay store. 

The frontend is an **Elm** application that integrates with **Stripe** for payment processing. It exposes an admin panel that provides workflows for processing orders, manually managing listings on both the website and eBay, and displays row-level ingest errors.

During the course of this project, I have been the only developer and have written every single line of non-library code, and I have **written and maintained documentation** so that their business doesn't close if I get hit by a **bus**. From a product perspective, I have **conceptualized, designed, and implemented all of the systems and functional areas** with only the **vaugest occasional suggestions** from the stakeholders within the organization.

Our current adventure is a project to **rework our physical inventory intake pipeline** by adapting it to a paperless process.

## Bright Health Group - Austin, TX (Remote)

**From 2020 - 2022**, I worked at Bright Health Group, a health insurance startup, as a **Sr. Data Engineer**. Early on, I was involved with the design and development of a **SQL Server and SSIS** data warehouse for healthcare provider data, and acted as the **T-SQL and C# SME** for my team. I single-handedly designed, developed, and delivered a large ETL integration with one of our trading partners in SQL Server and SSIS, then immediately rebuilt it in **Spark / Scala / Databricks** when our organization pivoted from Azure SQL to Databricks.

I've identified opportunities for workflow improvement, and took the initiative to build and release multiple internal frontend tools with **Elm**; my final project was a product to improve the workflow around data acquisition with **Elm and Azure Functions**. 

## WellSky - Austin, TX (Remote)

**From 2018 - 2020**, I worked as a **Data Engineer** at WellSky, a medical-industry software company. I developed **T-SQL and SSIS integrations** to populate a data warehouse that fed a Tableau product. I identified an opportunity to improve some of our release engineering around our Tableau product, and used **Elm and dotnet core** to develop a web-based deployment and management tool that integrated with several internal datasources, and **Tableau Server's REST API**.

## Evans Distribution - Melvindale, MI

**From 2017 - 2018**, I worked at Evans Distribution, a family-owned transportation and logistics company. My role was **"Applications Architect"**, but I was responsible for everything from reverse-engineering decades-old Dell Boomi EDI integrations to fixing printers to building an arcade game for a trade show.

I **implemented the full suite of Atlassian products** so that we could centralize our project planning, documentation, and helpdesk work; and **led the team on software-development best-practices**. At the owner's request, I designed, developed, and implemented a custom goal-tracking and progress management tool in **ASP.NET MVC**. I took on **project management** responsibilities, and acted as the **interim Director of Information Technology** for several months while the role was vacant.

## Spud Software & Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy - Flint, MI

**From 2013 - 2017**, I **wore many hats** at Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy. For the first two years, I worked directly for Spud Software, as a full-time resource on the Diplomat account; in 2015, I was hired direct by Diplomat. I was responsible for developing **T-SQL, SSIS, and Talend** integrations to generate and deliver hundreds of daily, weekly, and quarterly reports to pharmaceutical companies.

While at Spud, I took the lead on work for the Diplomat account and was used by Diplomat as a **lead developer and ETL architect**. I implemented processes and designed tools that allowed us to **shorten development and release cycles**. As an outcome of my work, Diplomat requested additional resources from Spud Software, and I was given the responsibility of managing Spud's presence on-site at Diplomat; at one point, I had **25 direct reports** spread across 3 departments within the Corporate Services division. I participated in hiring and firing decisions, and was responsible for conducting annual performance reviews.

I designed a new ETL architecture and report development workflow in **Talend**, and led the initiative to migrate all of our existing reports to the new toolchain and environment. The new architecture and environment allowed us to centralize our reporting delivery configuration parameters, capture logs on all executions, inspect row-and-column-level transformations on each report, re-run reports based on the state of the data at an arbitrary point-in-time, and shorten our development and release cycles even further. In addition, I acted as our team's **Git SME** and introduced SDLC best-practices.

After I was hired direct by Diplomat, I continued in my role as an **ETL architect**. I developed additional web-based tools in **ASP.NET MVC** and **WPF** to improve quality within the development / QA / release lifecycle, and developed a data warehousing and reporting environment paired to another ASP.NET MVC web application that allowed our analytics team to **query the source-to-target transformations on every row of every column of every report that we had ever generated**, and to design Tableau dashboards that **tracked how often we were sending empty or malformed data in contractually-required fields**, as part of an initiative to improve our organization's data quality.

## John Deere Landscapes - Troy, MI

**From 2010-2012**, I worked as an **Associate IT Analyst** for John Deere Landscapes. I was part of a team responsible for the development and maintenance of an in-house **Windows Forms and SQL Server** monolith that handled essential business functions, including but not limited to: sales, purchasing, instore point-of-sale, and reporting. I worked extensively on a hybrid T-SQL reporting engine.
